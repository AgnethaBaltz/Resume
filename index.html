    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>
      When I'm not immersed in the digital world, you'll find me with my running
      shoes tightly laced, ready to tackle the next kilometer on my journey
      towards a half marathon, or deeply buried in the pages of a fantasy book,
      where I immerse myself in the world of adventure. I'm always on the
      lookout for new skills to master – from languages to software – and I try
      to take more risks and step out of my comfort zone.
